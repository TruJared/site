# How To Easily Add A Spoiler Button To Your Webpage

### I created a spoiler button to toggle hidden text for my (old) (old) blog, I thought I would share the code here. Included is a version that can be inserted into a HTML file for anyone who may want to use a copy and paste version

_note: I was reluctant to keep this published, as the code isn't very well written, but I decided to keep it around for funsies; plus it does work, which is the main point_

Update for 2021: I added a [bare bones version](https://codepen.io/JaredsPens/pen/rNyLxBM).

[Original version](https://codepen.io/JaredsPens/pen/vJzMBz) - which inexplicably has nearly 3,000 views ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

 Or, you could just use the HTML5 [details](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/details) element.
