# Why I Paint Minis

If you're not familiar with miniature painting, it's a hobby that's been around for a long time, but has seen a resurgence in the last 10 years or so. There are a lot of reasons why people paint minis, but for me, it's a way to reconnect with my creative self and practice the art of creation. It's a way to disconnect from a screen and use with my hands. It's a way to practice patience and perseverance. It's a way to practice being present. It's a way to practice being a beginner. It's a way to practice being a student.

## Screens Rule Everything Around Me

About a year ago, I became frustrated that *ALL* my hobbies involved a screen of some type. My job (software development) involves a screen. My hobbies (gaming, reading, chess, watching YouTube(??)) involve a screen. So I decided to try something new. I decided to try painting minis. I had never painted anything before, but I figured it would be a good way to reconnect with my creative side.

I bought a starter kit from [Reaper Miniatures](https://www.reapermini.com/search/starter%20kit/latest/08906) and I was instantly hooked. I quickly amassed a collection of minis and paints and brushes and tools and books and... you get the idea. I was all in.

## OK... But what is a mini?

A mini is a small figurine that is used in tabletop games like Dungeons & Dragons, Warhammer, and Pathfinder. They are usually made of plastic, but can also be made of metal, resin, or even wood. They are usually 1-2 inches tall, but can be as small as 1/4 inch or as large as 6 inches. They are usually painted, but can also be left unpainted. They are usually based on a character from a game, but can also be based on a real person, a fictional character, or a completely original design

## Oh, so you play D&D?

No. My minis just sit on a shelf and stare aimlessly into the void that is my office. But, each mini has a life of it's own, a history, and a story to tell. Painting is the process that brings that story to life.

For example, I recently painted a shark pirate. I named him, "Captain Hamburger Casserole", and he most recently was spotted in the port of Port Royal, Jamaica, where he was seen drinking rum and eating hamburgers. Rumor is, he is heading to the Caribbean to find a new port to plunder.

A single miniature can takes 6 - 8 hours to paint (but professional painters can spend 100+ hours on a single mini). It gives me bite sized breaks from life to focus on something creative, without having to commit to a large project, and if I mess up, I can just strip off the paint and start over. If I *really* mess one up, the minis are cheap enough that I can just start over.

Maybe this whole post is just about an excuse to show off my minis. I'm OK with that, too.
