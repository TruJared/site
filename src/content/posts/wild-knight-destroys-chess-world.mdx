# Wild Knight Destroys Chess World

A picture is worth a thousand words, so I'll let this one speak for itself:

Opponent resigned next turn. Overall, it was a pretty solid game for me. Only 1 blunder, which as a relative noob, I'll take it. If you're curious to see how I set up this fork (double fork?, spork?, trident + 1?), you can [review the game](https://www.chess.com/game/live/69416750557).
