# Adding blog posts

Add markdown files similar to the ones in [blog/\*.md](src/pages/blog/), they need to have the following format:

```yaml
---

title: My markdown capabilities
description: "This is everything I know about markdown"

tags: ["astro", "learning in public", "setbacks", "community"]
---
```

# Navigating this repo

I suggest going through [src/pages/](src/pages/) first then through [src/components/](src/components/), you can easily see where to make edits.
